### Semi-Permanent makeup is NOT recommended for clients with the following conditions:

- If you are 18 years and under

- Pregnant or nursing | Must wait until after you are completely done with nursing as you run the risk of passing on any infections

- Diabetes (must be controlled & approved by your doctor) | Results in slow healing of the wound and a much higher risk for infection

- You have a pacemaker, or major heart problems

- High Blood Pressure (must be controlled)

- Have had Chemotherapy in the past year | Must not currently be on chemotherapy | Results in slow healing of the wound and a much higher risk of infection

- Autoimmune Disorders such as HIV/AIDS/Hepatitis, etc (must have doctor consent form for approval)

- Contagious diseases & viral infections

- Epileptic/prone to seizures

- Any treatment, medication, or illness that compromises the immune system/healing is NOT going to make you a good candidate for permanent makeup procedures

- Prone to Keloids & Hypertrophic Scarring | An area of irregular fibrous tissues that forms at the site of scar, or injury | Unfortunately you would not be a good candidate for any of these services

- Botox or derma fillers on, or around the enhancement area within the last month

- Within 3 weeks of chemical peel, must be fully healed prior to appointment

- Active sunburn/sunburned skin or frostbite

- Have any, or constant skin infections and/or irritations near or on the procedural brow area | Ex: Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Rosacea,Blisters, Eczema, problematic Acne, Sunburn, Rash, Moles or Skin Tags

- Open wounds/active acne in the brow area

- Allergies to Lidocaine, Epinephrine, pigmentation, and makeup

- Allergies to metals (iron, nickel)

- Current use of products with ingredients such as Alpha or beta hydroxy acids (Retin-A products) | Must discontinue use at least 14 - Days before appointment

- Use of blood thinner medications | Medications such as ibuprofin, aspirin, fish oils, acetaminophen, coumadin, etc can cause bleeding during the procedure, inhibiting the ability to retain pigment | Any medications listed above must be stopped at least 1 week before your appointment | PLEASE DO NOT STOP TAKING ANY MEDICATIONS THAT WILL AFFECT YOUR HEALTH!

- Use of cholesterol/blood pressure medications | These medications work against the blood platelets sticking together which can cause color loss

- On any skin medications such as steroids | This causes the skin to become more sensitive during the procedure

- Use of Accutane & your skin has not regulated | You must be off of Accutane for 1 year before procedure | This medication can thin the skin drastically which causes more skin trauma and slower healing for the client

#### PRE-APPOINTMENT INSTRUCTIONS | PLEASE READ BEFORE BOOKING AN APPOINTMENT

In order to achieve the best brows, proper care before and after the procedure is crucial. How your brows will turn out post-procedure all starts with a good canvas! The eyebrow area must be healthy, strong, non-sensitive, and non-irritated.​

Here’s how to prep your skin ready for the procedure:

- Do not pick/tweeze/wax/perform electrolysis 1 week before the procedure

- Do not tan 2 weeks prior to the service, or have a sunburned face

- Skin should be clear of blemishes, non-irritated, and sunburn-free for optimal results (especially around the procedure site)

- Do not have any type of facial 2 weeks prior to the procedure | Laser treatments, chemical peels, waxing, and brow tints should be done 2 weeks prior to your appointment

- Retinoids, AHA/BHA, Vitamin C, and any exfoliation products should be discontinued 2 weeks prior to your appointment if used around your forehead/the procedure area

- Do not work out the - Day of the procedure

- Do not have Botox / Dermal Fillers 4 weeks prior to the procedure as botox tends to make the muscles around the brows tighter | It should be done 4 weeks prior to your appointment—the longer the better

- Do not take Fish Oil, or Vitamin E one week prior to the procedure as they are natural blood thinners

​

In order to avoid excessive bleeding and poor color deposit:

- Do not drink coffee, or alcohol 24-48 hours before your procedure

- Do not take pain relievers such as Aspirin, Ibuprofen, etc 24 hours prior for pain relief as these also act as blood thinners

​

Please understand that everyone heals differently! Results are not always guaranteed, but I will do my best to get you there!

PLEASE NOTE:

In the event that a client fails to adhere to any of the above instructions, resulting in the appointment being rescheduled, your booking deposit will be forfeited and we will have to reschedule you. Your artist has the right to refuse service at any point due to non-compliant pre-appointment care instructions. Thank you for your cooperation!

#### AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS | POST-PROCEDURE | READ BEFORE BOOKING!

Achieving your dream brows is a 50/50 effort between the artist and you, the client. I will do my best to create your dream brows, but the bulk of the effort lies in how well you take care of your brows post-procedure. REMEMBER, as the client, you must take full responsibility and adhere to all of the strict aftercare instructions given to you in order to ensure that your brows heal correctly, without any risks of infections. Depending on how well your brows heal, a touch up may, or may not be needed.

Results are not always guaranteed and may vary for everyone for many reasons as we all heal differently, but I will do my best to get you there! You invested all your time and money to achieve the brows of your dreams so finish the mile strong! If you cheat on your aftercare, you are just hurting yourself.

The - Day of The Treatment: Absorb
I have included aftercare pads in your aftercare package. Wash your hands first before using. After the procedure, every hour for the first 4 hours, use one cotton pad to thoroughly clean the treated area to remove extra interstitial fluid. Use only on the - Day of the procedure.
NOTE: After using all the aftercare pads, if needed, gently blot the area with a clean tissue/gauze with filtered/purified water to absorb excess interstitial fluid from the brows. Do this every 5 minutes for the full - Day until the oozing has stopped. Removing this fluid prevents hardening of interstitial fluids.

- Days 1-7: Wash

Wash daily morning and night to remove bacteria, build up of product and cells, and dead skin. DO NOT WORRY! THIS DOES NOT REMOVE THE PIGMENT!

Gently wash your brows each morning and night with water and a pea-sized amount of antibacterial soap like Cetaphil. DO NOT use any cleansing products that contain acids (glycolic, lactic, or AHA), or exfoliants. Use your fingertips to gently wash the eyebrows by swiping in the direction of hair—do not rub back and forth. Gently cleanse the area for 10 seconds and rinse with water thoroughly ensuring that all soap is rinsed away. To dry, gently pat with a clean tissue.

- Days 1-7: Moisturize

Use a Q-Tip to apply a rice-grain amount of aftercare ointment and spread it across the brows, using a gentle, rolling motion 3 times a - Day. The ointment should be barely noticeable on the skin. NEVER put the ointment on a wet, or damp tattoo. Reapply ointment as needed when eyebrows feel dry, or when skin feels tight. Be sure not to over-apply, as this will suffocate your skin, delay healing, and affect the color retention.

IMPORTANT REMINDERS/TIPS

- Keep brows dry for 10 - Days | NO EXCEPTIONS! | NO shower water (on the brows), sweating from working out, swimming, hot tubs, saunas/steam rooms, etc | The salt in the sweat can pull pigment out from the skin which results in uneven healing/uneven color retention | If you are also exposing your brows to chlorine when swimming, the brow pigment will fade much faster

- Do NOT rub, pick, or scratch the treated area | As hard as it can be, leave the brows alone!

- Let your brows do its thing and let any scabbing, or dry skin naturally exfoliate away as picking can cause uneven healing, uneven color retention, scarring, or loss of color

​

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT SHOWERING:

Limit your showers to 5 minutes so that you do not create too much steam. Keep your face/procedure area out of the water while you wash your body, then, at the end of your shower, wash your hair. Your face should only be getting wet only at the END of the shower. AVOID excessive rinsing and hot water on the treated area. You may use the brow visor in your aftercare package to help protect your brows when showering.

​

- Do NOT apply any makeup/lotion/face wash onto the brows for the next 10 - Days | Use makeup removing wipes around the brows if you have foundation on and gently wash your brows twice a - Day with unscented, soap—do not rub your fingers back and forth along our brows—just do a few swiping motions

- Do NOT use Vaseline/100% Petrolatum/Petroleum Jelly | Vaseline suffocates the skin and does not allow the skin to heal properly! | Stick to the aftercare ointment given to you only!

- Do NOT use chemical/physical exfoliants/retinol on your brows as it includes AHA (glycolic acid, lactic acid, etc) and BHA (salicylic acid) which causes the pigment to fade | Basically, do NOT use anything on your brows that was not given to you
- No facials, botox, chemical treatments, or microdermabrasion for 4 weeks
- Avoid direct sun exposure and tanning for 4 weeks after the procedure | Stay out of the sun and wear a hat when outdoors while healing | Exposing your face without any sunblock results in huge fading and unevenness in the brows! | Once your brows have healed, you can apply a tiny amount of sunblock for protection

- Use a fresh pillowcase while you sleep

- Avoid sleeping on your face for the first 10 - Days | Sleep on your back as sleeping on your sides can result in uneven healing

- If for any reason you are getting an MRI scan, please inform your radiologist/technician of your permanent makeup | It is extremely rare, but those with permanent makeup may experience slight swelling, or burning in the affected areas Post-MRI scan

#### THE HEALING PROCESS | WHAT TO EXPECT

- Day 1: Eyebrows will look fresh, crisp, and clean. Brows may look slightly swollen & red post-procedure. Initially, the brow colors look warmer than what you may want/expect, but later, the pigments will oxidize with the air so the colors will become darker and that’s normal.

- Day 2-4: Eyebrows will be tender and look significantly darker. The brow area may appear uneven, dry, itchy, and irritated. You might even look mean/angry. These symptoms will dissipate each - Day, and symptoms will vary on an individual basis. Please keep in mind that this is completely normal and the brows will fade 30-40% lighter in a few - Days as the pigment will shrink and soften up.

- Day 5-8: Eyebrows are in the peeling/flaking phase. It’s hard to resist, but do NOT pick, scratch, rub, or remove the scabs/peel the skin. This will cause scarring, or loss of pigment retention which = uneven color retention/shape. Pigment rejection is totally normal. Any flaking dry skin is normal and will naturally fall off so LET YOUR BROWS DO ITS THING and leave them alone!

- Day 9-13: Eyebrows look lighter in color, but don’t worry! Your skin hasn’t healed completely & some of the pigment will return.

- Day 14-21: Healing is almost complete, color and definition return.

- Day 30: Healing is completed! Any spots from loss of pigment all depends on how well your skin took in the pigment. At this point, you’ll be able to tell if there’s anything you want to add or change to your eyebrows for your 8-10 week touch-up appointment!

In a nutshell:
Crisp/warm brows → dark brows → brows peel off/flake → new skin cells regenerate → brows get lighter → time for touch-up!

PLEASE NOTE:
I do not have control over the client’s natural healing and retention process as many factors come into play during the healing process and individual results are based on the client’s skin type, lifestyle, etc.

If you do not follow the aftercare instructions I have given you to the T, you might experience signs of infections in the procedural area. If have ANY alarming concerns regarding the following signs and symptoms, please contact a physician immediately as I am not a medical professional.
Symptoms include: continued vibrant redness, or swelling in the treated area, thick raised scabs, crusty texture, redness around the skin, dermatitis, skin rashes, elevated body temperature, fever, colored discharge (yellow/green/grey) with/without odor, pain, itchiness, or if the skin feels hot around the area.
